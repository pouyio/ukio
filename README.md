- The strategy is using the url to store the filters state. React context or redux state are more powerful options.
- For the sake of simplicity I opted for fetch instead a library (axios, react-query, etc) to make the api requests. In a real world app the complexity would require using one of those.
- The style is overly simplistic due to time constraints. Enhanced UX can be achieved with more time
- Responsive layout mobile friendly with some small tweks (apartments flex-row/flex-column)
- light/dark theme support

## IMPROVEMENTS

- Pagination should reset when the filters are changed
